## Your Web Application Title
Kitty Collector is a website where a user can input their cat's and maybe even their friend's cat's information to keep track of all their favorite cats. Fill out the four fields and click submit to see the inputted information population on the table.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I was able to connect MongoDB, create a cluster, and populate a collection with the data inputted from the website page. 



### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I used water.css framework because of the modern and simple look. I did make some small modifications such as the color scheme. The framework has a plain gray and white color scheme, while I prefer some more color and added some purple. Additionally, I made some adjustments to the placement of the buttons and the padding between them to have them fit the page better.
