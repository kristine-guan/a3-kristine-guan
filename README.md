## Your Web Application Title
Kitty Collector is a website where a user can input their cat's and maybe even their friend's cat's information to keep track of all their favorite cats. Fill out the four fields and click submit to see the inputted information population on the table.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I was able to create a single-page app to provide users a form to submit their cat information that will populate on the table once submitted. The table includes a derived table to inform the user about the cat's age category, and the user is also able to delete rows off the table.


### Design/Evaluation Achievements

## Classmate User Studies

Classmate #1
Last Name: Wu
What problems did the user have with your design?
the delete button placement did not communicate what the it would delete, which is completely understandable. The button only deletes the top row of the table, which is certaintly a limitation of my website.

What comments did they make that surprised you?
nothing much, she liked the color schedule which was good. 

What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
I would change the placement of the delete button. I would a delete button for each row, so the user can choose which row they would like to delete.

What problems did the user have with your design?
The alignement of the input boxes and the data table was a bit off. Also the placement of the delete button is not super indicative of its function.

What comments did they make that surprised you?
Nothing really, I know that my delete button is not super well executed.

What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
Similar to the other user study, but change up how I do the delete button so each row can be deleted. I would also add take a look at the alignment of the elements and how to clean it up more.
